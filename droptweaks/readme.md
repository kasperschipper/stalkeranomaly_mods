# JrK's drop tweaks

Two simple changes: 
* slighty increased the maximum condition drop quality for weapons and outfits.
  * like before this scales with stalker experience, but linearly now
  * max weapon condition for legendary stalkers: 0.65
  * max outfit condition for legendary stalkers: 0.5
* increased maximum ammo drops
  * max ammo roughly 1 full mag
  * for most guns thats 30
  * for snipers that's 10
  * for shotguns that's 8
  * for gauss that's 5
  * for pkm that's 50 (might make it worthwhile using this gun)
* minimum drop conditions and ammo unchanged
