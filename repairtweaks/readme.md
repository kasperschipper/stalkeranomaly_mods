# JrK's repair tweaks

## The Why

This mod is fairly simple; I didn't like how for Anomaly weapon/outfit part repair after going through the hassle of acquiring
parts and repairing them, you also needed toolkits that had very few uses. 

My fix was to repurpose toolkits as more of an investment; you buy an expensive toolkit once for the type of item you want to fix, 
but then enjoy quite a few uses out of it. In the long run this makes part replacement and upgrading cheaper, 
but I feel it is somewhat balanced by the fact that it requires a big upfront cost and it being locked behind requiring 
specific parts and upgrade kits. Both of those are not super common in the Zone.

Finally, because I felt it was pretty cool to have to replace parts to repair a gun or outfit below a certain threshold of condition, 
I practically removed the capability of toolkits to also function as repair kits. If your gun goes below the condition 
of the universal or specific cleaning kit (the best type of repair kit) you _need_ do to part replacement.

Finally, did some QoL changes where certain repair items have more uses, at a (nearly) 1-1 balance of higher cost. I didn't
feel like buying 3x files every time when I could just buy one with more uses at a higher price. I do like how the multitool works. 
I feel with these changes files, ramrods etc are still relatively cheap.

## The details
- Increased uses for all big toolkits from 4 to 25
- Roughly doubled prices for all big toolkits
- Set min repair condition for big toolkits to 99%
- Set some repair items uses from 2 to 5, increased cost (roughly) by 150%
